# Gene-Expression-Prediction-via-(AUTO ML)

##### 1. Auto ML is used to Predict the Gene Expression, for training the images are loaded directly and the size 140*140*3 is flattened to get 58800 flattened pixels/features on which PCA is applied to reduce the features.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Image-Processing-on-Tissue-for-Clustering

##### 1. Image Processing Techniques are performed to see how the transformed images would be helpful, all different transformed images were played for tasks of Clustering and Gene Expression Classification and Prediction

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Model-LIME-Bayesian-CapsuleNet

##### 1. The first Section is used to test different Transfer Learning Models for 3 class classification of Gene Expression, here, models trained are MobileNet, ResNet50, InceptionV3, epochs set were 35, 50 and 5 or 10, different learning rates and Optimization Techniques have been applied, the best Training Accuracy reached is 62% and Test Accuracy reached is 49%.

##### 2. The second section focuses on Bayesian Learning CNN, for Binary Classification.

##### 3. Model Interpretation via LIME is done after training from CNN.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Model-Interpretability-LIME

## This is a good notebook, where number of epochs is High, good LIME results also.

##### 1. The first 2 sections are for Gene Expression Classification via INceptionV3 and Model Interpretation by LIME.

##### 2. Tumor vs Non- Tumor Classification section K-Means transformed images are used for Binary Classification of Gene Expression and LIME results are available.

##### 3. The first 4 image tiles are combined and their Gene Expression is averaged and similar CNNs are applied.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# STimage_ResNet50_Basic-CNN

## This is again a good notebook to look at

##### 1. Here ResNet50 features were computed and and Basic CNN was applied, the number of epochs is also good.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ResNet50-Features-Gene-Expression-3Class-AUCROC

##### 1. Here, the ResNet50 features have been loaded from a csv file and the Gene Expression have been converted to Low, Medium and High on which a classification model is learned.

##### 2. The Model Interpretation is done for ResNet50 features both by SHAP and LIME.
